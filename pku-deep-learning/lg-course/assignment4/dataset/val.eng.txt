I like L.A. better .
All you have to do is take advantage of this rare opportunity .
I'll pick you up at your home .
It's worth the wait .
You didn't tell me Mary was so beautiful .
I did not play tennis yesterday .
That was years ago .
Let's leave .
I wonder why nobody told me .
She has a strong wish to work as an interpreter .
You're always criticizing me !
Can you read ?
Are they treated fairly ?
We are at school together .
It is less humid today than it was yesterday .
He goes to school to study every day .
I try .
You'll soon get used to speaking in public .
I saw a cat running after the dog .
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that .
I am unable to finish my homework .
He jumped onto the table .
Your opinion is similar to mine .
She plays tennis every Sunday .
You know that's not right .
He took her out for a drive .
She was only frightened, not injured .
She went into her room to change her dress .
You're too drunk to drive .
I barely escaped being hit by the truck .
The typhoon caused the river to flood .
When to start is the main problem .
I agree with you to some extent .
Will you put down that paper and listen to me ?
I thought the questions were easy .
My uncles come to see me from time to time .
I can barely stand his behavior .
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation ?
This coat fits you perfectly .
This room is cleaned by Tom .
He's opposed to racial discrimination .
There was complete silence .
I had to change clothes because what I was wearing wasn't appropriate for the situation .
Tom took out his key and opened the door .
How many people are there in your family ?
Did you bring a hair dryer ?
I'll take you to the bus stop .
I can't find my glasses .
Don't let her go out after dark .
Tom told Mary something she didn't want to hear .
Every time he comes here, he orders the same dish .
She has kept a diary for 3 years .
The reservation is already made .
Well, let's go .
My house is here .
All plants need water and light .
I'm having some problems compiling this software .
He owes his success both to working hard and to good luck .
He's such a sweetheart .
He gave correct answers to the questions .
She can speak English, of course .
Language is the means by which people communicate with others .
I decided to be a doctor .
I'm afraid there isn't any coffee left .
You'll understand later .
We ought to obey the law .
Don't step on the broken glass .
Nowadays nobody believes in ghosts .
What happened in the park ?
Tom sure talks a lot .
He is as tall as her .
We should call the doctor .
Let me try another one .
They're children .
Tom was the last one off the bus .
I looked for him in the supermarket .
It's said that she's a well-known actress .
The price does not include the box .
What'll actually happen is anyone's guess .
Tom says he's not feeling any better .
I chose the wrong one .
It happened in the blink of an eye .
Mt. Fuji can be seen from here .
I'm very hungry now .
We knew no one .
My grandfather died five years ago .
I like summer the best .
She freshened herself up before supper .
We discussed the plan yesterday .
Can I park my car here ?
The roses in the garden are blooming .
I went swimming in the river .
Where is the coffee shop ?
She takes care of my children .
We'll come back tomorrow .
We depend on you .
I know very little about Tom .
Do you want to know why I quit ?
Here is a photograph of my family .
I saw a beautiful waterfall there .
The embassy is located next to the Supreme Court .
Tom didn't agree to do it .
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise .
What did you answer ?
He rushed out of the office .
It's no big deal .
It makes no difference to me .
Are you tired ?
The sky is clear and full of stars .
Tom and I are almost done .
When did you get here ?
Who's going to believe that ?
I lived abroad for ten years .
Do you know if Tom has spoken to Mary recently ?
May I go to the restroom ?
He no longer lives here .
Where do the airport buses leave from ?
Promises are made to be broken .
We gave him up for dead .
Got it ?
Her goal is to become a teacher .
I'd like to change yen to dollars .
He lived abroad for many years .
These products are of the same quality .
What do you eat for breakfast ?
Could you take me to a movie ?
He managed to get there in time .
He lived abroad for much of his life .
All subscriptions must be paid before the end of this year .
He prefers football to baseball .
Beware of the dog !
Someone told me that this boy cannot hear .
Don't speak to anyone .
English and German are two related languages .
He asked me why I was laughing .
I can comfort her .
She has to take a remedial course in English .
We know everything .
What do you usually do in your spare time ?
He's afraid of snakes .
This is never going to end .
Tom suggested that I change the lock on my door .
Save yourself .
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride .
Stay out of my room .
I wish I could go to the party with you .
He made his way to the room .
I am studying now .
Why didn't you follow my advice ?
That's a good idea !
They sell candy .
No security system is foolproof .
The doctor may have said so .
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open .
I remember mailing the letter .
I will play the guitar for you .
My wife asked me to throw this old hat away .
It's almost time for Tom to go .
How did your journey begin ?
You must pay attention to him .
I didn't participate in the conversation .
It was Tom that saved the girl .
You're on the right track .
We often associate black with death .
Let's take a look .
He left high school at seventeen .
Who cares when she gets married ?
Let your hair down a little .
No one escaped alive .
He wrote a book about a jungle adventure .
Can you wake me up at seven o'clock tomorrow morning ?
I don't have the slightest idea .
Excuse me for interrupting you .
Above all, be patient .
Let them decide .
His wife is one of my friends .
Do you have any idea where Tom could be ?
Is she your mother ?
We have the same problem .
I've got everything that you want .
My gums are bleeding .
If Tom can't tell me, then no one can .
You'll be confused .
I watched TV this morning .
Beauty's in the eye of the beholder .
Science has changed my life .
As soon as the bell rang the teacher came into the classroom .
I saw him reading a book .
We must never confuse the two .
You should be more careful .
He is the richest man on earth .
I know that it's hard to believe .
I don't want either of them .
She has hundreds of books .
You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
I will not attend the party .
I haven't made up my mind yet .
Outside the school, she saw people with no homes living in cardboard boxes .
I hope I can see you at Christmas .
He may be jogging around the park .
Let me do that .
The scenery was beautiful beyond description .
Do you know which road leads to my house ?
At first, he could not speak English at all .
They say that golf is very popular in Japan .
You have to turn in the reports on Monday .
I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour .
We could walk there together .
His horse jumped over the fence .
Tom is awfully sick .
You are a good person .
You didn't protect me .
You can't count on their help .
We have less than five minutes to evacuate the whole building .
There wasn't anyone in the room .
Are you going outside ?
Shakespeare is too hard to read .
Why should I care what you think ?
Everyone attacked my opinion .
Why are you wearing that scarf ?
You should pay more attention to his warnings .
Tom was the first to arrive and the last to leave .
Why is the sky blue ?
We tried to stop you .
This happens all the time .
I would have liked to come with you, but I didn't have time .
Spanish is her mother tongue .
That's exactly how I feel .
Tom visits Mary every time he goes to Boston .
He stuck his pencil behind his ear .
Don't run risks .
She gets up at seven .
Where does it leave from ?
The contract is in the bag, so let's go out and celebrate .
I was nervous, too .
You're barking up the wrong tree .
Japan relies on Arab countries for oil .
I swim once a week .
Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was born in a log cabin in Kentucky .
The plan was executed .
How can Tom not understand that ?
This directly concerns you .
He got a master's degree in law .
I find that it's typical for him to come too late .
You're our only hope .
Let me buy you another one .
He bought a Honda .
We're still vulnerable .
What are you watching ?
I've rented a room not far from here .
I thank you from the bottom of my heart .
Please feel free to ask questions .
Tom should have plenty of time .
What you are saying does not make sense .
Sit wherever you like .
You did a good job .
He is afraid of getting lung cancer .
No one had anything left to say .
I didn't mean to disturb you .
Would you like to have a drink before dinner ?
I should have taken the money .
One of the dogs is alive .
She was holding a small parasol in her hand .
This could be fun .
I miss you. I need to see you. Could I come over ?
I will not go to school tomorrow .
There was not a tree in sight .
She's a girl, but she's brave .
Please sing a song .
Tom needs to see you in ten minutes .
I can't find my glasses .
What did you tell your boss ?
Nothing ever makes him angry .
The meeting will be held tomorrow .
Pay the cashier on the way out .
I'll meet to you at eight .
Those shoes won't do for climbing .
I have always kept my promises .
She had two accidents within a year .
I want the other one .
What are your weekend plans ?
I always keep my promises .
It's under the table .
Feel free to ask any questions .
Close your mouth .
Where's the nearest drugstore ?
I'd like a room facing the garden .
Do you have these shoes in my size ?
I had my brother repair my bicycle .
My sister sometimes makes our dinner .
Can you freeze it ?
There's a hole in this bucket .
He asked me if I was busy .
They broke into the jewelry shop .
She's about the same height as you .
"Did he write a letter yesterday?" "Yes, he did. "
Please think about the problem .
I don't know what is worse .
What do you think about it ?
The balloon was caught in the tree .
Over-sleeping is no excuse for being late .
We found that everyone was asleep .
The two men were business partners .
I'd better get back home .
I've climbed Mt. Fuji twice .
What Tom said doesn't apply in this situation .
Tom wrote two books .
Do you know the concert schedule of London Symphony Orchestra ?
Tom wrote down something in his notebook .
It's going to rain this evening .
Do you mind if I open the door ?
I've lost a little weight .
How lovely !
I was aware of that fact .
Could you cancel my reservation ?
A cornered rat will bite a cat .
The path zigzagged up the steep slope .
The weather report says we'll get three inches of snow .
Lie still .
As we went around the corner, the lake came into view .
He got accustomed to the new way of living .
I was afraid I might be late .
Come to my house this afternoon .
When water freezes it becomes ice .
He's not stupid .
I think you should do that before you go home today .
Stop, or I'll shoot .
I wish we had won the game .
We had a lot of snow last year .
Give me your phone .
My grandson is still a baby .
He's two years older than me .
He left an hour ago .
Sorry, that was none of my business .
Eating habits differ from country to country .
I'm crazy about you .
What time do you start work ?
I asked the doctor some questions .
They waited in line for the bus .
I'm studying in the library .
Don't touch my camera .
Teachers also make mistakes .
You made me laugh .
Hurry up, or you'll miss the bus .
Please make yourself at home .
Would you lend me your pencil ?
The city was full of starving soldiers .
She is not as patient as you .
I'd wear a helmet .
Something must be wrong with the machinery .
He did not think he needed their protection .
The tablecloth is in the cabinet .
Where is my umbrella ?
He's out taking a walk .
There is an urgent message for you .
Tom decided not to wait .
Some of them are healthy, but others are not .
It's okay to go .
Everyone wants what they can't have .
Do you think I'm stupid ?
You'd better go to bed at once .
They are trying to keep costs down .
Here is your bag .
She gave me a present .
I took the elevator to the third floor .
I'm looking forward to seeing you next Sunday .
Rome is famous for its ancient architecture .
Tom doesn't like cheese .
He slept well last night .
The old man starved to death .
He made me his own assistant .
He always wears dark glasses .
English is spoken in Singapore .
There's an outside chance of winning .
That's avoidable .
Run .
I have to go meet with Tom .
I'll attend .
I don't speak German .
All aboard !
How long has it been since you saw your girlfriend ?
We are not going on vacation .
We played basketball yesterday .
Taking off is easier than landing .
Where are you planning to spend the night ?
I remember this word .
I guess you're right .
You are selling him short .
Wash your feet .
I was ten minutes late for school .
He made me go against my will .
Tom should've already discussed that with you .
Please take more care in the future .
I don't care what they say .
There isn't anyone in the room .
Where is the police station ?
About how much will I have to pay for all the treatments ?
I talked with her for an hour .
Who does the cooking in your home ?
Of course she can speak English .
How did you meet Tom ?
I think I'm going to cry .
Mom, can I go swimming ?
How did you get to know him ?
Is it really possible ?
Fasten your seat belts .
Be respectful to your superiors, if you have any .
They sometimes help us .
He likes watching TV .
You'd better have your hair cut at once .
Sing us a song, please .
I'll study your report .
That's my dictionary .
English isn't easy to master .
She planted roses in the garden .
Do you play a musical instrument ?
Tom didn't know what he'd say to Mary .
Mary likes milk very much .
I've met so many new people .
We have no reason to feel ashamed .
Both Tom and Mary can't speak French .
She said that she gets up at six every morning .
He is a waiter in a seaside restaurant .
He and his sisters are currently living in Tokyo .
She gave us lots to eat .
Is this ladder strong enough to bear my weight ?
I work every day but Sunday .
Please put your shoes on .
She will do her best to be here on time .
This box is too bulky to carry .
Get out !
I got her to clean my room .
Do you know a good restaurant ?
No one answered my question .
I love watching soccer games .
My house is close to a bus stop .
My house is a long way from here .
Yours is over there .
I sometimes dream of my mother .
My uncle gave me the watch .
Does Tom play tennis ?
How long did it take you to translate this book ?
He drove the car, listening to music on the radio .
Waiter, I'd like to order .
Tom knows the difference .
When I heard the news, I wanted to cry .
What's the weather like now ?
She always gets her own way .
There used to be an old temple here .
It was getting dark .
Tom knew Mary wouldn't let him down .
He convinced me of his innocence .
Do you want more ?
I am happy to have so many good friends .
You didn't write anything .
Where's the nearest station ?
I ran a race with him .
They don't need a reason .
I had a phone call from him .
Do you think the weather will be fine tomorrow ?
We use a lot of water every day .
Tom went to Boston for a week .
