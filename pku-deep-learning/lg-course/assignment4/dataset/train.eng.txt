The stripes were horizontal .
We have your size, but not in that color .
I still can't speak French .
Tom added broccoli to the stew .
He must have missed the train .
We do what we want to do .
I don't know whether she will come .
I am busy cooking at the moment .
Wherever she goes, she is well liked .
Go and buy three bottles of coke .
Which goes faster, a ship or a train ?
Tom has forgotten how to do that .
An old man was resting in the shade of the tree .
What are you doing ?
We used to go skating every weekend .
We were worried .
She sat on the bench .
He made a speech in plain English .
I'm leaving for Chicago next week .
Leave a space between the lines .
Maybe I should just tell Tom the truth .
I didn't want to humiliate you .
The chances are he's already heard the news .
How do you account for that ?
World War I broke out in 1914 .
Did you make that mistake on purpose ?
If you're happy, I'm happy .
Tom is fluent in three languages .
She has a good command of English though she was brought up in Japan .
Compared to our house, yours is a mansion .
Those chairs are in the way .

We have to do something, Tom .
Tom wrote us postcards .
Who's the girl at the door ?
She is going to Chiba Stadium .
I don't go to school on Sundays .
We'll have to go back .

Do you not understand basic logic ?
He's a good person .

Children like chocolate .
I study about two hours every day .
An aging population will require more spending on health care .
He still hasn't answered my letter .
The police will look into the case .
We were bored .
I owe my success to him .
You talk too much .
It was the only way to go .
He even called me an idiot .
Can you help me ?
He was too young to live alone .
I wonder if he loves me .
He came back last August .
The average height of the girls in class is over 155 centimeters .
How do you feel now ?

Not all of us can speak English .
I had a slight headache last night .
Our problems are nothing compared to hers .
Her idea is better than yours .
He asked her seven times to marry him .
See you then .
What kind of sandwich do you want ?
The price of meat dropped .
Tom wished he could understand French .
Her skin is smooth .
Well done !
I think it won't succeed .
I baked cookies .
I think that it's true .
No, thank you. I'm just looking around .
Why doesn't he tell me jokes anymore ?
If we don't keep walking we'll be late .
You should come home before six .
You shouldn't have gone there .

I don't remember what Tom looked like .
Let me stop you right there. We don't want to hear about that .
I saw him after ten years .
We can't know what the future has in store .
Do you want some more tea ?
We woke up very early in order to see the sunrise .
They're typical youngsters .
That's my coat .
The service here is awful .
No, I didn't write it .
It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work .

We weren't told where he came from .
None of these buses go to Shinjuku .
Why did you leave the class yesterday ?
You'd better go by bus .
It's dangerous !
Did you call ?
Tom and I know each other quite well .
I am a student .
I ran across an old friend near the bank .
I was just going to write a letter .

I do not agree with you at all .
Don't you ever clean your room ?
I am content with my job .
The calculator on the table is mine .
I want something to read .
No words can relieve her deep sorrow .

What time is it ?
Learning a foreign language is difficult .
We don't live in Boston .
It can't be true .
You should've told me yesterday .

I went there by bus and train .
That's life .
I'll come and see you one of these days .
Can anyone pronounce this word ?
Do I have to bring my son to your office ?
I have nothing to do with this matter .
She believes whatever he says .
This is too expensive .
You're so right .
These are cakes that she baked herself .
I thought you were my friend .
I really liked the gift you gave me .
We didn't start the fire .
Don't make fun of people .
She's neither rich nor famous .
Which is your book ?

My father went fishing .
I've just started playing tennis .
How did Tom get out of jail ?
If I were invisible, I wouldn't have to wear anything .
I'm coming home, Tom .
Someone called .
I am not used to drinking coffee without sugar .
The show was wonderful, but the tickets were too expensive .
I looked around me .
Even a child could do it .
Why can't we talk now ?
What time is it by your watch ?
You're lying, aren't you ?
We had a heated discussion about it .
You are to come with me .
She was a tall, thin girl with long, soft brown hair .

I am too short .
Please forgive me for being late .
You're working too hard. Take it easy for a while .
For here, or to go ?
When I hear this song, I think of you, and miss you .
I was surprised at his strong resemblance to his father .
Would you like some of those pictures ?
Put the book back on the shelf .

You've got to wake up .
Asia is much larger than Australia .
I don't worry about the risk .
We can't stay in here very long .
Please speak slowly .
I could swear there's something inside this box .
I don't like to go out when it's dark .
The policeman captured the man who was running .
My house is close to the park .

Birds fly .
I like the way you walk .
Tom knows you better than he knows anyone else .
My brother became an engineer .
Which fruit do you like the best ?
