MSParS (V1.0): a Multi-perspective Semantic ParSing Dataset for Knowledge-based Question Answering      

Open Domain Semantic Parsing
Task 2 - Open Domain Semantic Parsing

The goal of this task is to predict the logical form (in lambda-calculus) of an input question based on a given knowledge graph. For example, for question “when was Bill Gates born?”, the predicted logical form should be . Each question in our dataset is annotated with entities, the question type and the corresponding logical form. We split this dataset into a train set, a development set and a test set. Both train and development sets will be provided to participating teams, while the test set will NOT. After participating teams submit their output files, we will evaluate their performances.
